cleanlab documentation
======================

`cleanlab <https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab>`_ **automatically finds and fixes label issues in your ML datasets.**

| This reduces manual work needed to fix data errors and helps train reliable ML models on noisy real-world datasets. cleanlab has already found thousands of `label errors <https://labelerrors.com>`_ in ImageNet, MNIST, and other popular ML benchmarking datasets, so let's get started with yours!

Quickstart
==========

1. Install ``cleanlab``
-----------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: pip

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install cleanlab

   .. tab:: conda

      .. code-block:: bash

         conda install -c cleanlab cleanlab

   .. tab:: source

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install git+https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab.git


2. Find label errors in your data
---------------------------------

cleanlab finds issues in *any dataset that a classifier can be trained on*. The cleanlab package *works with any model* by using model outputs (predicted probabilities) as input -- it doesn't depend on which model created those outputs.

If you're using a scikit-learn-compatible model (option 1), you don't need to train a model -- you can pass the model, data, and labels into :py:meth:`CleanLearning.find_label_issues <cleanlab.classification.CleanLearning.find_label_issues>` and cleanlab will handle model training for you. If you want to use any non-sklearn-compatible model (option 2), you can input the trained model's out-of-sample predicted probabilities into :py:meth:`find_label_issues <cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues>`. Examples for both options are below.

.. code-block:: python

    from cleanlab.classification import CleanLearning
    from cleanlab.filter import find_label_issues

    # Option 1 - works with sklearn-compatible models - just input the data and labels ãƒ„
    label_issues_info = CleanLearning(clf=sklearn_compatible_model).find_label_issues(data, labels)

    # Option 2 - works with ANY ML model - just input the model's predicted probabilities
    ordered_label_issues = find_label_issues(
        labels=labels,
        pred_probs=pred_probs,  # out-of-sample predicted probabilities from any model
        return_indices_ranked_by='self_confidence',
    )

:py:class:`CleanLearning <cleanlab.classification.CleanLearning>` (option 1) also works with models from most standard ML frameworks by wrapping the model for scikit-learn compliance, e.g. huggingface/tensorflow/keras (using our KerasWrapperModel), pytorch (using skorch package), etc.

By default, :py:meth:`find_label_issues <cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues>` returns a boolean mask of label issues. You can instead return the indices of potential mislabeled examples by setting `return_indices_ranked_by` in :py:meth:`find_label_issues <cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues>`. The indices are ordered by likelihood of a label error (estimated via :py:meth:`rank.get_label_quality_scores <cleanlab.rank.get_label_quality_scores>`).

.. important::
   The predicted probabilities, ``pred_probs``, from your model **must be out-of-sample**. Never provide predictions on the same data points used to train the model -- these predictions are overfit and unsuitable for finding label errors. Details on how to compute out-of-sample predicted probabilities for your entire dataset are :ref:`here <pred_probs_cross_val>`.

3. Train robust models with noisy labels
----------------------------------------

cleanlab's :py:class:`CleanLearning <cleanlab.classification.CleanLearning>` class adapts any existing (`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_ `compatible <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html>`_) classification model, `clf`, to a more reliable one by allowing it to train directly on partially mislabeled datasets.

When the :py:meth:`.fit() <cleanlab.classification.CleanLearning.fit>` method is called, it automatically removes any examples identified as "noisy" in the provided dataset and returns a model trained only on the clean data.

.. code-block:: python

   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from cleanlab.classification import CleanLearning

   cl = CleanLearning(clf=LogisticRegression())  # any sklearn-compatible classifier
   cl.fit(train_data, labels)

   # Estimate the predictions you would have gotten if you trained without mislabeled data.
   predictions = cl.predict(test_data)


4. Dataset curation: fix dataset-level issues
---------------------------------------------

cleanlab's :py:mod:`dataset <cleanlab.dataset>` module helps you deal with dataset-level issues by  :ref:`finding overlapping classes <cleanlab.dataset.find_overlapping_classes>` (classes to merge), :ref:`rank class-level label quality <cleanlab.dataset.rank_classes_by_label_quality>` (classes to keep/delete), and :ref:`measure overall dataset health <cleanlab.dataset.overall_label_health_score>` (to track dataset quality as you make adjustments).

The example below shows how to view all dataset-level issues in one line of code with :py:meth:`dataset.health_summary() <cleanlab.dataset.health_summary>`. Check out the dataset tutorial for more examples.

.. code-block:: python

   from cleanlab.dataset import health_summary

   health_summary(labels, pred_probs, class_names=class_names)
